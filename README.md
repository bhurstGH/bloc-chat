Welcome to my playground. The Bloc Chat app has been an environment to experiment with various facets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React, and Firebase.

It may not look pretty but I learned a great deal working through this Bloc project while putting my own spin on the requirements as well as my own decisions and design choices. Armed with that experience, I would definitely structure the application differently if I started over from scratch. I'm moving forward in my curriculum now but I would like to refactor much of what is here and implement more features (admins, user lists/active channel users, more ways to sign up and authenticate, etc).

My programming roots go back to the 90s with IRC and the mIRC client's proprietary scripting language. That is my original coding exposure. So it was a great joy to work with a chat app. I instinctively wanted to implement functionality I remember from those days. This is not my last foray into chat apps and protocols, I'm sure.

Some personal highlites and takeaways from this project:

* Learning to work with and utilize Flexbox in CSS.
* Experimenting with animations and transitions in CSS
* Working with Firebase and its JavaScript implementations. Particularly user authentification and deleting/renaming database entries while syncing them with React state.
* Really growing my understanding of React components and the state/props relationships between parents and children. Passing functions around in particular was enlightening not only about React itself but JavaScript and `this` as well.
* Getting the SendMessage textarea to work as I intended (Enter to submit, shift+enter for a new line, etc).
* Arrow functions are cooler than I originally gave them credit for.
* While I'm at it, `stopPropagation()` and JS destructuring are pretty swell too.
